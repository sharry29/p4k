        <p>On Monday, October 7th, 2019, Pitchfork Media released <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-songs-of-the-2010s/">their choices</a> for the best 200 songs of the decade. Pitchfork is an influential voice in the independent music community, known for their detailed album reviews and their signature designation of "Best New Music" for songs and albums that they consider to be exceptional on release. Annually, Pitchfork releases a "Best of" list for the previous year, which is a huge source of excitement for me and which sparks avid discussion among me and my friends. As the culmination of a whole decade of music, this list's release loomed large over my entire 2019. I had many questions about its content from the personal ("How closely do my favorites match up with the consensus of these music writers?") to the practical ("How will new songs from 2019 stack up against classics from years and years ago?"). On the morning that the list dropped, I read through their rankings and I started to take a closer look at the landscape of these superlative tunes. </p>
        <p>The first question I set out to explore was how the songs were distributed over the past ten years. Would the Pitchfork editors would make an effort to include equal representation from each year? How would the passing of time reveal itself in the list? I was curious how this group of writers would weigh the novelty of new tracks against the nostalgia for songs that came out in bygone eras of their lives.</p>

        <h2>2019 is an Underrepresented Year</h2>
        <p>Only six songs from 2019 appear in Pitchfork's list, and 2012 has the most songs featured at 28.</p>

        <h2>Drake Had the Decade's Midas Touch</h2>
        <p>Drake appeared on seven of the tracks in the list. He featured on three of these tracks.</p>

        <h2>What Were the Big Labels of the Decade?</h2>
        <p>Nine of the Top 200 songs were self-released, placing independent releases on par with the other two leading labels of the decade: XL and Columbia.</p>
