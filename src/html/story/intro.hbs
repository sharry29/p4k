  <p>On Monday, October 7th, 2019, Pitchfork Media released <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-songs-of-the-2010s/">their choices</a> for the best 200 songs of the decade. Pitchfork is an influential voice in the independent music community, known for their detailed album reviews and their signature designation of "Best New Music" for songs and albums that they consider to be exceptional on release. Annually, Pitchfork releases a "Best of" list for the previous year, which sparks avid discussion among me and my friends. As the culmination of a whole decade of music, this list's release loomed large over my entire 2019. I had many questions about its content from the personal ("How closely do my favorites match up with the consensus of these music writers?") to the practical ("How will new songs from 2019 stack up against classics from years ago?"). On the morning that the list dropped, I read through their rankings and I started to take a closer look at the landscape of these superlative tunes. </p>
